You can create you own profiles , it will play any sound when the desired key is pressed.


Steps to Create you own Profile 

- create a sound folder with wave files and set the path in json file
- for example your sound folder name is "cat_sounds"
- and it contains "meow.wav" sound
- then your path will be ./cat_sounds/meow.wav
- follow this json format to create new profiles
{ 
    "tab":"path",
    "capslock":"path",
    "shift":"path",
    "ctrl_l":"path",
    "alt_l":"path",
    "space":"path",
    "alt_gr":"path",
    "ctrl_r":"path",
    "shift_r":"path",
    "enter":"path",
    "backspace":"path",
    "other_keys":"path"
}
- you should not change the .json format
- copy and paste the above code and just change the path
- here "other_key" means every other key on the keyboard
- and finally put this .json file in "Profiles" folder
- as a good practice name the .json file same as the folder of sounds it helps identifying later
- here in for example my json file should be named "cat_sounds.json"
- email me if you have any problems editing the code
- or you can text me on my instagram
